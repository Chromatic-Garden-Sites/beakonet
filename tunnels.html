    <h1>Beako Tunnels</h1>
    <p>This is mainly inspired by the death of the route48 project, which I was a part of the management staff of. As a result of it's death, for now I will offer v4 and v6 tunneling for free to anyone who needs it. This is on a manual basis, email me at bgp@beako.net or message me on discord if you were in the route48 discord server. tunnels to all!</p>
    <p>Test IP is 128.254.226.6</p>
    <p>Good luck to hobbynets out there, I'll do my part to support you. Manual provisioning only, but I'm here.</p>
